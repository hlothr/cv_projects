# cv_projects
I have created two projects listed below
## Word Parser
A tkinter project, after giving a path to a text file and pressing a button the program will display this file word by word with a speed of 0,15 seconds per word using the following python libraries: [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html) and [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html)
## Usage
In the yellow rectangle specify the the text file and push the "Start" button. After that the words will appear in the pink rectangle
## Music Downloader
In that project I used [youtube_dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md) in order to download .wav and .mp4 files. The downloads can be done in singular manner or in batch by choosing different option specified in the program
# pip download
after clining the repository all you need to do is in the venv terminal write:
```
pip install -r requirments.txt
```
